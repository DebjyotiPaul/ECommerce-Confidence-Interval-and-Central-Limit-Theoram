# Walmart-Confidence-Interval-and-Central-Limit-Theoram
Walmart's management aims to scrutinize customer purchase behavior, particularly spending disparities between genders, like whether women outspend men on Black Friday, among 100 million customers.

# About Walmart
Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.

# Business Problem
The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).

# Dataset
The company collected the transactional data of customers who purchased products from the Walmart Stores during Black Friday. The dataset has the following features:
* User_ID:	User ID
* Product_ID:	Product ID
* Gender:	Sex of User
* Age:	Age in bins
* Occupation:	Occupation(Masked)
* City_Category:	Category of the City (A,B,C)
* StayInCurrentCityYears:	Number of years stay in current city
* Marital_Status:	Marital Status
* ProductCategory:	Product Category (Masked)
* Purchase:	Purchase Amount

# Procedural menthodology

## Defining Problem Statement and Analyzing basic metrics

### Observations on shape of data, data types of all the attributes, conversion of categorical attributes to 'category' (If required), statistical summary
- The dataset consists of [insert number] entries and [insert number] attributes.
- Data types of attributes include [insert data types].
- Categorical attributes have been converted to 'category' data type.
- Statistical summary:
  - Mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation for continuous variables.
  - Value counts and unique attributes for categorical variables.

## Non-Graphical Analysis
- Value counts and unique attributes for each categorical variable.
- Summary statistics for each continuous variable.

## Visual Analysis - Univariate & Bivariate

### For continuous variable(s):
- Distplot, countplot, histogram for univariate analysis.
- Boxplot for bivariate analysis.

### For categorical variable(s):
- Boxplot for categorical variables.

### For correlation:
- Heatmaps and Pairplots for identifying correlations.

## Missing Value & Outlier Detection
- Identify missing values and handle them appropriately.
- Detect outliers using statistical methods.
